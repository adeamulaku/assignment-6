## Assignment 6
This project is a simple text processing web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input text into a textarea, upon which the application processes the text and generates a frequency table of the words entered. The top five most frequent words are then displayed in a table format, providing users with insights into the most common terms in their input. 

Through building this project, I gained valuable experience in working with the Document Object Model (DOM) API in JavaScript, dynamically creating HTML elements, and styling the user interface to create an aesthetically pleasing experience.
